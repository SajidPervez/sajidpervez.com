My career is at an intersection of various skill sets from *appsec*, , *cloudsec*,  and *coding*. These are my core areas of expertise. Everyday challanges and much needed *empathy* adds spice and sweetness into my role.

Titles keep changing but my work revolves around finding ways to solve software security puzzles and figuring solution for every design flaw and coding bugs.

I am currently a **Principal Product Security Engineer** at **[MYOB](https://myob.com)**, a SaaS accounting software company supporting all types of businesses.

I am originally from Pakistan and immigrated to Australia in 2015.

I started my career in **2005** as **a developer** writing code for cryptographic solutions (PKI) and integrating PKI and 2FA based strong authentication solutionss into enterprise environments. Some more fun parts of the job involved breaking applications.

Below is a my cyber career journey in Australia.
