My career is at an intersection of various skill sets from *appsec*, , *cloudsec*,  and *coding*. These are my core areas of expertise. Everyday challanges and much needed *empathy* adds spice and sweetness into my role.

Titles keep changing but my work revolves around finding ways to solve software security puzzles and figuring solution for every design flaw and coding bugs.

I'm a *Principal Security Engineer* at **[MYOB](https://myob.com)**, a SaaS accounting software company supporting all types of businesses.

Before that I was *Application Security Lead* at **[NBN](https://nbnco.com.au)**, a national broadband network compnay that is the digital backbone of Australia and is constantly evolving to keep communities and businesses connected.

Before **NBN**, I was *Senior Application Security Engineer* at **[AGL](https://agl.com.au)**, one of the largest Australian energy and telecom company.
