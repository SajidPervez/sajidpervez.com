I am a product security engineer who is supposed to wear multiple hats within security multiple times during a day.

* I am core appsec engineer - talking to engineers about scanner findings and remediations, or doing threat modeling 
* In the next meeting I am a cloud security person - helping a team with securing their api with cloud security controls 
* Then I put on _security architect_ hat - reviewing the solution architecture 
* And at times I writing code to solve specific problem 

The role is an intersection of various skill sets from *cybersecurity*, *coding*, *empathy*, and full of *absolute challanges*.
