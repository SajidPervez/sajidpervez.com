My career is at an intersection of various skill sets from appsec, cloudsec, and coding. These are my core areas of expertise. Everyday challenges and much needed empathy adds spice and sweetness into my role.  

Titles keep changing but my work revolves around finding ways to solve software security puzzles and figuring solutions for every design flaw and coding bug.

I am currently a Principal Product Security Engineer at [MYOB](https://myob.com), a SaaS accounting software company supporting all types of businesses.

I started my career in 2005 as a developer writing code for cryptographic solutions (PKI) and integrating PKI and 2FA based strong authentication solutions into enterprise environments. Some more fun parts of the job involved breaking applications.

Below is my cyber career journey in Australia.
