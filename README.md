# About Sajidpervez.com

This is my digital corner on the web where I write essays, share the books and podcasts I’m enjoying, and collect resources for other security practitioners.

The site now runs on **Next.js** using the Magic Portfolio template from Once UI. The migration keeps all of the original Astro-era content, but takes advantage of Magic Portfolio’s opinionated design system, MDX-driven content model, and hybrid rendering support.

## Current stack
- Next.js 15 + Magic Portfolio (Once UI)
- MDX content for essays and portfolio posts
- Tailwind-based Once UI styling
- Hosted on Vercel

## Local development

```bash
# install dependencies
cd magic-portfolio
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```
