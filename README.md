# About Sajidpervez.com

This is my digital corner on the web where I write essays, share my reading and  listening collections with anyone and everyone.

Well, you might think why I choose Astro when a simple blog could be created on platforms like Hugo, my answer would be flexibility that Astro offers is way more than what Hugo offers.

I built my site from ground up rather than using any template and hence have learned a new tool which I can use in the future for some other projects.

## My tech stack
- AstroJS - Main framework
- TailwindCSS - Styling and typography
- Fonts - Canela Deck and Lato
- Deployment - Vercel
